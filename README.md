# Upload Image App

## Getting Started

### 1 - Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/randymxd06/Upload_Files_NestJS_VueJS.git
```

### 2 - Install the dependencies

```bash
pnpm install-all
```

### 3 - Copy the `.env.template` files, paste them where they are and rename them to `.env` in the `nest-app` and `vue-app` folders

You can use the following command so you don't have to do it manually, although the install-all command should do it for you.

```bash
pnpm copy:envs
```

### 4 - Raise up the project

```bash
pnpm dev
```
